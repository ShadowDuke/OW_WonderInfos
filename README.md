## Notes

**Example for the pyramid:**

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.

Egyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Cheops and was constructed over a 20-year period.<br>Cheops's vizier, Hemiunu, is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 147 metres (481 ft) tall.
The lengths of the sides at the base are difficult to reconstruct, given the absence of the casing, but recent analyses put them in a range of 230 metres (755 ft).
